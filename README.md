Turn static CLI commands into TUIs with ease

Test this out by cloning the repo and running `cargo run -- -- docker ps` or `cargo run -- -- git branch`.

Right now some default keybindings are defined for common commands like `ls`, `docker ps`, `git branch`, `git status --short`, etc. In the future you'll be able to configure keybindings for any command you want via a yaml config file.
